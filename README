This is a work-in-progress collection of tests for the Inform 6 library.

I intend (over time) to fill in all of the exercises from the DM4,
plus any ad-hoc cases that seem desirable for testing library
features. I don't have a timeline for getting that done, however. It's
a low priority.

To run these tests, you must have:

- The Inform 6 compiler
- The Inform libraries release 6/11. (Tests are not checked against the
  in-progress 6/12 libraries!)
- A Glulx interpreter compiled with the RemGlk library.

Then you can run this sort of command:

    python3 dotest.py --compiler ~/src/inform6/inform --terp ~/bin/glulxer *.inf

Each test looks like regular Inform 6 source code, except that the source
ends with the line

    #END; ! test

This ends compilation and also signals that a list of tests will follow.
A test looks like

    * testname
    initial text
    more initial text
    > command
    command response

The test ensures that the lines of text in each block appear *somewhere
in* the appropriate game output. A test line may be a subset of the game
output line, and it may be anywhere in the output -- line order is not
checked.

There can be more than one test (marked by asterisk lines). Each test
starts at the beginning of the game and is a separate run-through.
