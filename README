This is a work-in-progress collection of tests for the Inform 6 library.

I intend (over time) to fill in all of the exercises from the DM4,
plus any ad-hoc cases that seem desirable for testing library
features. I don't have a timeline for getting that done, however. It's
a low priority.

To run these tests, you must have:

- The Inform 6 compiler
- The Inform libraries release 6/11. (Tests are not checked against the
  in-progress 6/12 libraries!)
- A Glulx interpreter compiled with the RemGlk library.

Then you can run this sort of command:

    python3 dotest.py --compiler ~/src/inform6/inform --lib ../../i6lib-611 --terp ~/bin/glulxer *.inf
